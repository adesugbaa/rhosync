Handling Errors in your RhoSync Application
===

If your source adapter raises an instance of `SourceAdapterException`, the resulting message will be sent to the client's sync callback(in `@params['error_message']`).  See the rhodes [sync exception handling docs](/rhodes/synchronization#handling-exceptions) for more details.

You can use `SourceAdapterException` as a convenient way to notify your application of various error conditions.

## Handling Exceptions


For example, your delete method might check the web service HTTP response code was 200 to make sure the record was deleted:

	:::ruby
	def delete(delete_hash)   
	  rest_result = RestClient.delete("#{@base}/#{delete_hash['id']}")
	  if rest_result.code != 200
	    raise SourceAdapterException.new("Error deleting record.")
	  end
	end

**NOTE: When your adapter method raises an exception, no data is removed from the adapter's master document.**
